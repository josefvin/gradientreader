<p>
Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</p>

<p>
Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys&rsquo; house. The wife had
discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who
had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that
she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs
had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but
all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it.
Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living
together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had
more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and
household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband
had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house;
the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend
asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off
the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had
given warning.
</p>

<p>
Three days after the quarrel, Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky&mdash;Stiva,
as he was called in the fashionable world&mdash;woke up at his usual hour, that
is, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, not in his wife&rsquo;s bedroom, but
on the leather-covered sofa in his study. He turned over his stout,
well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into a long
sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side and buried his
face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes, how was it now?&rdquo; he thought, going over his dream.
&ldquo;Now, how was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt;
no, not Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in
America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the tables sang,
<i>Il mio tesoro</i>&mdash;not <i>Il mio tesoro</i> though, but something
better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and they
were women, too,&rdquo; he remembered.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes twinkled gaily, and he pondered with a smile.
&ldquo;Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that was
delightful, only there&rsquo;s no putting it into words, or even expressing it
in one&rsquo;s thoughts awake.&rdquo; And noticing a gleam of light peeping in
beside one of the serge curtains, he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge
of the sofa, and felt about with them for his slippers, a present on his last
birthday, worked for him by his wife on gold-colored morocco. And, as he had
done every day for the last nine years, he stretched out his hand, without
getting up, towards the place where his dressing-gown always hung in his
bedroom. And thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his
wife&rsquo;s room, but in his study, and why: the smile vanished from his face,
he knitted his brows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...&rdquo; he muttered, recalling everything that had
happened. And again every detail of his quarrel with his wife was present to
his imagination, all the hopelessness of his position, and worst of all, his
own fault.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she won&rsquo;t forgive me, and she can&rsquo;t forgive me. And the
most awful thing about it is that it&rsquo;s all my fault&mdash;all my fault,
though I&rsquo;m not to blame. That&rsquo;s the point of the whole
situation,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; he kept repeating in
despair, as he remembered the acutely painful sensations caused him by this
quarrel.
</p>

<p>
Most unpleasant of all was the first minute when, on coming, happy and
good-humored, from the theater, with a huge pear in his hand for his wife, he
had not found his wife in the drawing-room, to his surprise had not found her
in the study either, and saw her at last in her bedroom with the unlucky letter
that revealed everything in her hand.
</p>

<p>
She, his Dolly, forever fussing and worrying over household details, and
limited in her ideas, as he considered, was sitting perfectly still with the
letter in her hand, looking at him with an expression of horror, despair, and
indignation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? this?&rdquo; she asked, pointing to the letter.
</p>

<p>
And at this recollection, Stepan Arkadyevitch, as is so often the case, was not
so much annoyed at the fact itself as at the way in which he had met his
wife&rsquo;s words.
</p>

<p>
There happened to him at that instant what does happen to people when they are
unexpectedly caught in something very disgraceful. He did not succeed in
adapting his face to the position in which he was placed towards his wife by
the discovery of his fault. Instead of being hurt, denying, defending himself,
begging forgiveness, instead of remaining indifferent even&mdash;anything would
have been better than what he did do&mdash;his face utterly involuntarily
(reflex spinal action, reflected Stepan Arkadyevitch, who was fond of
physiology)&mdash;utterly involuntarily assumed its habitual, good-humored, and
therefore idiotic smile.
</p>

<p>
This idiotic smile he could not forgive himself. Catching sight of that smile,
Dolly shuddered as though at physical pain, broke out with her characteristic
heat into a flood of cruel words, and rushed out of the room. Since then she
had refused to see her husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that idiotic smile that&rsquo;s to blame for it all,&rdquo;
thought Stepan Arkadyevitch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s to be done? What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; he said to
himself in despair, and found no answer.
</p>

<h4>Chapter 2</h4>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch was a truthful man in his relations with himself. He was
incapable of deceiving himself and persuading himself that he repented of his
conduct. He could not at this date repent of the fact that he, a handsome,
susceptible man of thirty-four, was not in love with his wife, the mother of
five living and two dead children, and only a year younger than himself. All he
repented of was that he had not succeeded better in hiding it from his wife.
But he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife, his
children, and himself. Possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins
better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would
have had such an effect on her. He had never clearly thought out the subject,
but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of
being unfaithful to her, and shut her eyes to the fact. He had even supposed
that she, a worn-out woman no longer young or good-looking, and in no way
remarkable or interesting, merely a good mother, ought from a sense of fairness
to take an indulgent view. It had turned out quite the other way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!&rdquo; Stepan
Arkadyevitch kept repeating to himself, and he could think of nothing to be
done. &ldquo;And how well things were going up till now! how well we got on!
She was contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in
anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she liked.
It&rsquo;s true it&rsquo;s bad <i>her</i> having been a governess in our house.
That&rsquo;s bad! There&rsquo;s something common, vulgar, in flirting with
one&rsquo;s governess. But what a governess!&rdquo; (He vividly recalled the
roguish black eyes of Mlle. Roland and her smile.) &ldquo;But after all, while
she was in the house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is that
she&rsquo;s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh, oh! But
what, what is to be done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no solution, but that universal solution which life gives to all
questions, even the most complex and insoluble. That answer is: one must live
in the needs of the day&mdash;that is, forget oneself. To forget himself in
sleep was impossible now, at least till nighttime; he could not go back now to
the music sung by the decanter-women; so he must forget himself in the dream of
daily life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we shall see,&rdquo; Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and
getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the
tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare
chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his
feet that carried his full frame so easily. He pulled up the blind and rang the
bell loudly. It was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend, his
valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes, his boots, and a telegram. Matvey was
followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are there any papers from the office?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,
taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the table,&rdquo; replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at
his master; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sent from the carriage-jobbers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the
looking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the looking-glass, it
was clear that they understood one another. Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s eyes
asked: &ldquo;Why do you tell me that? don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Matvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and gazed
silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or
themselves for nothing,&rdquo; he said. He had obviously prepared the sentence
beforehand.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract attention to
himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through, guessing at the words,
misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and his face brightened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,&rdquo; he said,
checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path
through his long, curly whiskers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like
his master, realized the significance of this arrival&mdash;that is, that Anna
Arkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a reconciliation
between husband and wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone, or with her husband?&rdquo; inquired Matvey.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his upper
lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the looking-glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna?&rdquo; Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do
what she tells you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want to try it on,&rdquo; Matvey understood, but he only said,
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed, when
Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came back into the room with
the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let him
do&mdash;that is you&mdash;as he likes,&rdquo; he said, laughing only with his
eyes, and putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his head
on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a good-humored and
rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eh, Matvey?&rdquo; he said, shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir; she will come round,&rdquo; said Matvey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come round?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think so? Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,
hearing the rustle of a woman&rsquo;s dress at the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; said a firm, pleasant, woman&rsquo;s voice, and the
stern, pockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at the
doorway.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is it, Matrona?&rdquo; queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up
to her at the door.
</p>

<p>
Although Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his wife,
and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house (even the
nurse, Darya Alexandrovna&rsquo;s chief ally) was on his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; he asked disconsolately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She is
suffering so, it&rsquo;s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house
is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg her forgiveness,
sir. There&rsquo;s no help for it! One must take the consequences....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;ll do, you can go,&rdquo; said Stepan Arkadyevitch,
blushing suddenly. &ldquo;Well now, do dress me.&rdquo; He turned to Matvey and
threw off his dressing-gown decisively.
</p>

<p>
Matvey was already holding up the shirt like a horse&rsquo;s collar, and,
blowing off some invisible speck, he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the
well-groomed body of his master.
</p>

<h4>Chapter 3</h4>

<p>
When he was dressed, Stepan Arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself,
pulled down his shirt-cuffs, distributed into his pockets his cigarettes,
pocketbook, matches, and watch with its double chain and seals, and shaking out
his handkerchief, feeling himself clean, fragrant, healthy, and physically at
ease, in spite of his unhappiness, he walked with a slight swing on each leg
into the dining-room, where coffee was already waiting for him, and beside the
coffee, letters and papers from the office.
</p>

<p>
He read the letters. One was very unpleasant, from a merchant who was buying a
forest on his wife&rsquo;s property. To sell this forest was absolutely
essential; but at present, until he was reconciled with his wife, the subject
could not be discussed. The most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary
interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with
his wife. And the idea that he might be led on by his interests, that he might
seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the
forest&mdash;that idea hurt him.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished his letters, Stepan Arkadyevitch moved the office-papers
close to him, rapidly looked through two pieces of business, made a few notes
with a big pencil, and pushing away the papers, turned to his coffee. As he
sipped his coffee, he opened a still damp morning paper, and began reading it.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper, not an extreme one, but
one advocating the views held by the majority. And in spite of the fact that
science, art, and politics had no special interest for him, he firmly held
those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his
paper, and he only changed them when the majority changed them&mdash;or, more
strictly speaking, he did not change them, but they imperceptibly changed of
themselves within him.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views; these
political opinions and views had come to him of themselves, just as he did not
choose the shapes of his hat and coat, but simply took those that were being
worn. And for him, living in a certain society&mdash;owing to the need,
ordinarily developed at years of discretion, for some degree of mental
activity&mdash;to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat. If
there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views, which were
held also by many of his circle, it arose not from his considering liberalism
more rational, but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life.
The liberal party said that in Russia everything is wrong, and certainly Stepan
Arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money. The liberal party
said that marriage is an institution quite out of date, and that it needs
reconstruction; and family life certainly afforded Stepan Arkadyevitch little
gratification, and forced him into lying and hypocrisy, which was so repulsive
to his nature. The liberal party said, or rather allowed it to be understood,
that religion is only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the
people; and Stepan Arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service
without his legs aching from standing up, and could never make out what was the
object of all the terrible and high-flown language about another world when
life might be so very amusing in this world. And with all this, Stepan
Arkadyevitch, who liked a joke, was fond of puzzling a plain man by saying that
if he prided himself on his origin, he ought not to stop at Rurik and disown
the first founder of his family&mdash;the monkey. And so Liberalism had become
a habit of Stepan Arkadyevitch&rsquo;s, and he liked his newspaper, as he did
his cigar after dinner, for the slight fog it diffused in his brain. He read
the leading article, in which it was maintained that it was quite senseless in
our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all
conservative elements, and that the government ought to take measures to crush
the revolutionary hydra; that, on the contrary, &ldquo;in our opinion the
danger lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of
traditionalism clogging progress,&rdquo; etc., etc. He read another article,
too, a financial one, which alluded to Bentham and Mill, and dropped some
innuendoes reflecting on the ministry. With his characteristic quickwittedness
he caught the drift of each innuendo, divined whence it came, at whom and on
what ground it was aimed, and that afforded him, as it always did, a certain
satisfaction. But today that satisfaction was embittered by Matrona
Philimonovna&rsquo;s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household. He
read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that
one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a
young person seeking a situation; but these items of information did not give
him, as usual, a quiet, ironical gratification. Having finished the paper, a
second cup of coffee and a roll and butter, he got up, shaking the crumbs of
the roll off his waistcoat; and, squaring his broad chest, he smiled joyously:
not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind&mdash;the
joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion.
</p>

<p>
But this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him, and he grew
thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
Two childish voices (Stepan Arkadyevitch recognized the voices of Grisha, his
youngest boy, and Tanya, his eldest girl) were heard outside the door. They
were carrying something, and dropped it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,&rdquo; said the little
girl in English; &ldquo;there, pick them up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s in confusion,&rdquo; thought Stepan Arkadyevitch;
&ldquo;there are the children running about by themselves.&rdquo; And going to
the door, he called them. They threw down the box, that represented a train,
and came in to their father.
</p>

<p>
The little girl, her father&rsquo;s favorite, ran up boldly, embraced him, and
hung laughingly on his neck, enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that
came from his whiskers. At last the little girl kissed his face, which was
flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness, loosed her
hands, and was about to run away again; but her father held her back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is mamma?&rdquo; he asked, passing his hand over his
daughter&rsquo;s smooth, soft little neck. &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said,
smiling to the boy, who had come up to greet him. He was conscious that he
loved the boy less, and always tried to be fair; but the boy felt it, and did
not respond with a smile to his father&rsquo;s chilly smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mamma? She is up,&rdquo; answered the girl.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch sighed. &ldquo;That means that she&rsquo;s not slept again
all night,&rdquo; he thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, is she cheerful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother,
and that her mother could not be cheerful, and that her father must be aware of
this, and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly. And she
blushed for her father. He at once perceived it, and blushed too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She did not say we must do
our lessons, but she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to
grandmamma&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,&rdquo; he said,
still holding her and stroking her soft little hand.
</p>

<p>
He took off the mantelpiece, where he had put it yesterday, a little box of
sweets, and gave her two, picking out her favorites, a chocolate and a fondant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For Grisha?&rdquo; said the little girl, pointing to the chocolate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo; And still stroking her little shoulder, he kissed her
on the roots of her hair and neck, and let her go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The carriage is ready,&rdquo; said Matvey; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s
someone to see you with a petition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Been here long?&rdquo; asked Stepan Arkadyevitch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many times have I told you to tell me at once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,&rdquo; said
Matvey, in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be
angry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, show the person up at once,&rdquo; said Oblonsky, frowning with
vexation.
</p>

<p>
The petitioner, the widow of a staff captain Kalinin, came with a request
impossible and unreasonable; but Stepan Arkadyevitch, as he generally did, made
her sit down, heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her, and
gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply, and even wrote her, in
his large, sprawling, good and legible hand, a confident and fluent little note
to a personage who might be of use to her. Having got rid of the staff
captain&rsquo;s widow, Stepan Arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to
recollect whether he had forgotten anything. It appeared that he had forgotten
nothing except what he wanted to forget&mdash;his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; He bowed his head, and his handsome face assumed a
harassed expression. &ldquo;To go, or not to go!&rdquo; he said to himself; and
an inner voice told him he must not go, that nothing could come of it but
falsity; that to amend, to set right their relations was impossible, because it
was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love, or to
make him an old man, not susceptible to love. Except deceit and lying nothing
could come of it now; and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It must be some time, though: it can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; he
said, trying to give himself courage. He squared his chest, took out a
cigarette, took two whiffs at it, flung it into a mother-of-pearl ashtray, and
with rapid steps walked through the drawing-room, and opened the other door
into his wife&rsquo;s bedroom.
</p>

<h4>Chapter 4</h4>

<p>
Darya Alexandrovna, in a dressing jacket, and with her now scanty, once
luxuriant and beautiful hair fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck,
with a sunken, thin face and large, startled eyes, which looked prominent from
the thinness of her face, was standing among a litter of all sorts of things
scattered all over the room, before an open bureau, from which she was taking
something. Hearing her husband&rsquo;s steps, she stopped, looking towards the
door, and trying assiduously to give her features a severe and contemptuous
expression. She felt she was afraid of him, and afraid of the coming interview.
She was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in
these last three days&mdash;to sort out the children&rsquo;s things and her
own, so as to take them to her mother&rsquo;s&mdash;and again she could not
bring herself to do this; but now again, as each time before, she kept saying
to herself, &ldquo;that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some
step&rdquo; to punish him, put him to shame, avenge on him some little part at
least of the suffering he had caused her. She still continued to tell herself
that she should leave him, but she was conscious that this was impossible; it
was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as
her husband and loving him. Besides this, she realized that if even here in her
own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly,
they would be still worse off where she was going with them all. As it was,
even in the course of these three days, the youngest was unwell from being
given unwholesome soup, and the others had almost gone without their dinner the
day before. She was conscious that it was impossible to go away; but, cheating
herself, she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was
going.
</p>

<p>
Seeing her husband, she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as
though looking for something, and only looked round at him when he had come
quite up to her. But her face, to which she tried to give a severe and resolute
expression, betrayed bewilderment and suffering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he said in a subdued and timid voice. He bent his head
towards his shoulder and tried to look pitiful and humble, but for all that he
was radiant with freshness and health. In a rapid glance she scanned his figure
that beamed with health and freshness. &ldquo;Yes, he is happy and
content!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;while I.... And that disgusting good
nature, which everyone likes him for and praises&mdash;I hate that good nature
of his,&rdquo; she thought. Her mouth stiffened, the muscles of the cheek
contracted on the right side of her pale, nervous face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she said in a rapid, deep, unnatural voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he repeated, with a quiver in his voice. &ldquo;Anna is
coming today.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is that to me? I can&rsquo;t see her!&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you must, really, Dolly....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go away, go away, go away!&rdquo; she shrieked, not looking at him, as
though this shriek were called up by physical pain.
</p>

<p>
Stepan Arkadyevitch could be calm when he thought of his wife, he could hope
that she would <i>come round</i>, as Matvey expressed it, and could quietly go
on reading his paper and drinking his coffee; but when he saw her tortured,
suffering face, heard the tone of her voice, submissive to fate and full of
despair, there was a catch in his breath and a lump in his throat, and his eyes
began to shine with tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God&rsquo;s sake!... You
know....&rdquo; He could not go on; there was a sob in his throat.
</p>

<p>
She shut the bureau with a slam, and glanced at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dolly, what can I say?... One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot nine
years of my life atone for an instant....&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She dropped her eyes and listened, expecting what he would say, as it were
beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&mdash;instant of passion?&rdquo; he said, and would have gone on, but
at that word, as at a pang of physical pain, her lips stiffened again, and
again the muscles of her right cheek worked.

<p>
&ldquo;Go away, go out of the room!&rdquo; she shrieked still more shrilly,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t talk to me of your passion and your
loathsomeness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She tried to go out, but tottered, and clung to the back of a chair to support
herself. His face relaxed, his lips swelled, his eyes were swimming with tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; he said, sobbing now; &ldquo;for mercy&rsquo;s sake, think
of the children; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and punish me, make me
expiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything! I am to blame,
no words can express how much I am to blame! But, Dolly, forgive me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sat down. He listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was unutterably
sorry for her. She tried several times to begin to speak, but could not. He
waited.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember
them, and know that this means their ruin,&rdquo; she said&mdash;obviously one
of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the
last few days.
</p>

<p>
She had called him &ldquo;Stiva,&rdquo; and he glanced at her with gratitude,
and moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in the
world to save them, but I don&rsquo;t myself know how to save them. By taking
them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious
father&mdash;yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened,
can we live together? Is that possible? Tell me, eh, is it possible?&rdquo; she
repeated, raising her voice, &ldquo;after my husband, the father of my
children, enters into a love affair with his own children&rsquo;s
governess?&rdquo;
